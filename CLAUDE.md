# Claude Code Instructions

Follow these instructions when writing code or documentation for the project.

## Project Structure

- `docs/architecture` - Contains the architecture documentation
- `src` - Contains the main application code

## Technology stack

Look at [Solution strategy](docs/architecture/04-solution-strategy.md) to
understand the technology stack used in the application.

## Testing the project

Look at [Quality](docs/architecture/10-quality.md) to understand the testing
requirements for the application.

## Documenting the code

Make sure to document the code properly in the architecture documentation
located at `docs/architecture`. We follow the arc42 template for structuring
the architecture documentation.

When changing code, make sure to:

- Document important structures in the building blocks view
- Document important flows in the runtime view
- Update the glossary with new terms introduced in the feature
