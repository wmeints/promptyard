## Getting Started

### Using the dev container

This project contains a dev container to help you get started quickly. Make sure you have the 
following extension installed: [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

Next, Reopen the repository in a container by running the command `Dev containers: reopen in container`.

The dev container includes a PostgreSQL database to store the application data.
You can access the database directly using the following command:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d promptyard -U postgres -W
```

### Setting up a local environment file

You'll need to set up a `.env` file in the root of the project directory to configure the application correctly.
Please create the `.env` file and add the following content

```env
GITHUB_ID=
GITHUB_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_SECRET=
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/promptyard?schema=public"
```

**Note:** you'll have to set up a new [Github OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/apps) before you can
authenticate users.

You also need to generate a new secret using the following command and store it as `NEXT_SECRET`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Restoring the dependencies

After opening the project in the dev container, restore the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the application

Use the following commands to run the application:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

The first command pushes any missing database schema changes to the local PostgreSQL database.
The second command starts a development version of the app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying to production

This project is packaged up as a docker container. You can find it on the
[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/willemmeints/promptyard).
