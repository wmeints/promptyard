## Developing

### System requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [Node 22 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

**Important:** Make sure you install pre-commit globally, especially if you're using vscode. We found that the
pre-commit hooks don't work quite right when you have the pre-commit executable only in the virtual environment of the
project.

### Restoring dependencies

We use the uv package manager to manage the dependencies in the project. Make sure to
synchronize the dependencies. This also installs the correct Python version for the project.

```bash
uv sync
```

### Configuring the pre-commit hooks

Before you start working on the code, make sure you have the pre-commit hooks installed.
These hooks help you avoid common mistakes when working on this code base.

```bash
pre-commit install
```
