# Feature: Create prompt templates

I want users to be able to create prompt templates either in their personal
profile or as part of a prompt template repository.

## Creating prompt templates in the personal profile

Users have a special prompt template repo attached to their user profile.
They can add prompt templates through their personal profile page. 

## Creating prompt templates in a repository

Users can also create prompt templates in a prompt template repository.
They need to navigate to an existing prompt template repository and start the
creation process from the repository.

## Important prompt template details

Each prompt template has at least a title, and content. Optionally users can 
provide a description and a set of tags for the template. A template is specific
for one or more products.
