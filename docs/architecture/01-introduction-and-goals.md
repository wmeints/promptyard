# Introduction and goals

Promptyard is a website where people can share prompts, skills, and agents with their colleagues.
We use crowdsourcing principles to let the community decide which content is the most useful.

## Goals

- Provide a shared marketplace where authors can share prompts, skills, 
  and agents to make it easier for us to improve how people are using language
  model based solutions in their work.
  
- Provide a place where developers and knowledge workers can find prompts, 
  skills, and agents to help them achieve more with tools like ChatGPT, 
  Microsoft Copilot, Github Copilot, Claude, and Claude Code.

## High level requirements

- Allow users to share prompts, skills, and agents via the portal so their colleagues can benefit from research they've done.
- Allow users to quickly download and install prompts, skills, and agents in their coding projects.
- Allow users to quickly copy/paste prompts to use them in ChatGPT or other online AI chat solutions.
- Make it easy for users to find prompts based on tags or by using search.
