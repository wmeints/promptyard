# Assumptions

This section covers the key assumptions we made while developing promptyard.

- **No deep integration with AI tools:** I assume that I can't connect or
  integrate with AI tools. So users must be able to copy the contents of a
  prompt template to the computer's clipboard. For developers this is slightly
  different, because all coding agents support the use of prompt templates
  stored on disk within the project directory.
