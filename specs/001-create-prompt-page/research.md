# Research: Create Prompt Page

**Generated**: 2025-10-30  
**For Feature**: 001-create-prompt-page

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. E2E Testing Framework for Next.js + TypeScript

**Decision**: Playwright  
**Rationale**: 
- Native TypeScript support with excellent type safety
- Officially recommended by Next.js team
- Built-in test generation and debugging tools
- Cross-browser testing capabilities
- Better performance than alternatives (Cypress, Puppeteer)
- Integrates well with Vitest ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Good but heavier, slower test execution
- Puppeteer: Lower-level, requires more boilerplate
- TestCafe: Good but less ecosystem support

### 2. React Hook Form Best Practices for Tag Input

**Decision**: Custom controlled component with react-hook-form Controller  
**Rationale**:
- Controller provides proper integration with react-hook-form validation
- Custom tag component allows autocomplete implementation
- Maintains form state consistency
- Supports real-time validation requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Uncontrolled components: Poor integration with form validation
- Third-party tag libraries: Often lack TypeScript support or customization

### 3. Slug Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Custom slug generation with collision detection  
**Rationale**:
- Simple algorithm: slugify title + check uniqueness + append number if needed
- Database constraint on slug uniqueness prevents race conditions
- Performance-optimized with single query for collision detection

**Alternatives considered**:
- UUID-based slugs: Not user-friendly
- Hash-based slugs: Potential collisions, not readable

### 4. Database Schema for Tags

**Decision**: Separate tags table with many-to-many relationship  
**Rationale**:
- Enables tag reuse across prompts
- Supports autocomplete functionality
- Normalizes tag data (lowercase)
- Prevents data duplication

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON column: Poor queryability, no referential integrity
- Text array: Limited PostgreSQL support, no autocomplete

### 5. shadcn UI Components Selection

**Decision**: Form, Input, Textarea, Button, Badge components  
**Rationale**:
- Form component integrates well with react-hook-form
- Badge component perfect for tag display
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Built-in accessibility features

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom components: More work, potential accessibility issues
- Other UI libraries: Would break design consistency
